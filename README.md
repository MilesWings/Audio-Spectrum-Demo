This game is a demonstrative project, a concept about using music to create animation.
By converting the audio spectrum into usable variables, those variables can be used in game objects to make them perform numerous actions. This version uses music to change the shapes of props and to cycle through a character's list of animations, based on sound intensity and beats.

By running the game, you can chose between 3 tracks by clicking in their respective buttons. Music will play and you can watch the character dance according to the music.
